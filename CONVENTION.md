# Naming conventions for files and directories

1. Use lowercase letters for all file and directory names.

2. Use hyphens (-) to separate words in file and directory names.
   For example, use `my-file` instead of `myfile` or `my_file` or `myFile`.

3. Avoid using spaces or special characters in names.

4. Use descriptive names that reflect the content or purpose of the file or directory.
