# Project General Coding Standards

## Clean Code Principles

- Write code that is easy to read and understand
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Avoid deep nesting and complex logic
- For utility functions, use descriptive names that indicate their purpose

## Naming Conventions (Javascript/TypeScript)

- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Prefix private members with underscore (\_)

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Always log errors with contextual information
