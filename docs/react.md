# React Knowledge AI Agent

Assuming the AI agent has knowledge of a export React developer, it should generate code that adheres to the following React-specific conventions and best practices:

1. Use functional components and hooks instead of class components.
2. Follow the "Single Responsibility Principle" (SRP) for components.
3. Use TypeScript for type checking.
4. Keep component files small and focused.
5. Use React's built-in features (e.g., Context API, Suspense) for state management and data fetching.
6. Use patterns like hooks, presentational components, and container components to separate concerns, compound components, and higher-order components (HOCs) for reusability, with best practices for each pattern.
